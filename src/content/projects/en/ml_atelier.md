## **Objectives**

The objective of this project was to familiarize myself with different Machine Learning techniques such as supervised learning and semi-supervised learning.

## **Works**
* **Workshop_1** : A task using supervised learning.
* **Workshop_2** : A task using neural networks and semi-supervised learning.

## **Technologies Used**

- `Python`
- `Jupyter Notebook`
- `Scikit-Learn`
- `Pandas`

## **Conclusion**

I learned a lot from these workshops. I was able to discover how to make models more efficient by choosing an appropriate model and finding parameters adapted to the dataset.

Moreover, I realized that not all data are necessary to train a model and that some even disrupt learning, so they must be carefully selected.

Finally, I learned that before doing all this, it was necessary to know the dataset and clean the data in order to make the following learning as relevant as possible.
