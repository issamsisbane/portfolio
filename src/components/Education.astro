            During my tenure at Polytech Lyon, I was exposed to a diverse and
            rigorous curriculum covering a broad range of subjects, each
            contributing to my comprehensive understanding of computer science
            and engineering.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2 text-justify">
            In the field of <b>data science</b>, I delved into advanced topics
            such as Big Data, with a particular emphasis on machine learning
            techniques. Through hands-on projects and theoretical study, I
            gained proficiency in analyzing large datasets and deriving
            meaningful insights to inform decision-making processes.
        </p>

        <p class="my-2 text-justify">
            I had courses about <b>Information Systems</b> which provided me with
            valuable insights into the design and management of complex information
            systems in urban environments. This involved understanding the integration
            of various technologies and data sources to support urban planning and
            development initiatives.
        </p>

        <p class="my-2 text-justify">
            In the realm of <b>project management</b>, I acquired essential
            skills and techniques for effectively planning, executing, and
            monitoring projects from conception to completion. This included
            aspects such as project planning, risk management, and stakeholder
            communication.

        <p class="my-2 text-justify">
            Courses in <b>Algorithmics</b>, <b>Graph Theory</b>, and <b
                >Discrete Optimization</b

            equipped me with a diverse toolkit of <b
                >problem-solving techniques</b
            >. From developing efficient algorithms to modeling and solving
            complex optimization problems, these courses enhanced my analytical
            and critical thinking skills. Notably, I also received specialized
            training in linear optimization techniques, enabling me to solve
            complex problems by finding good solutions without necessarily
            finding the optimal solution, utilizing heuristics.
        </p>

        <p class="my-2 text-justify">
            Throughout my studies, I actively engaged in <b>group projects</b>,
            where I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills to
            real-world scenarios. These projects often focused on emerging
            technologies such as <b>mobile and web development</b>, allowing me
            to gain practical experience in designing and implementing software
            solutions to address specific needs and challenges.
