        <p class="my-2 text-justify">
            During my internship in the <b>United States</b>, I had the
            opportunity to discover the current IT architecture of <b
                >Thuasne USA</b
            > and the challenges and obstacles related to migrating to a <b
                >common domain</b
            > when small companies are acquired by larger ones.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2 text-justify"></p>
        During my stay, I had the opportunity to <b>train</b> a colleague on
        <b>Azure & IoT</b> technologies. I also worked with the company's teams on
        a potential project to equip shoes with <b>IoT</b> sensors and transmit data
        to the
        <b>Cloud Azure</b>.
        <p class="my-2 text-justify">
            Additionally, I worked on a project to <b>digitalize</b> the production
            line, aiming to replace paper documents with electronic documents accessible
            via SharePoint. I designed and implemented an <b>Azure</b> architecture
            that allows for <b>dynamic</b> QR codes. This was <b>essential</b> because
            orders and other printed documents change daily. Since the nature of
            a QR code is
            <b>immutable</b>, it had to be made <b>dynamic</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2 text-justify">
            Finally, I was able to provide a <b>detailed documentation</b> on this
            work, its functioning, and how to deploy it. I was able to follow and
            work with my colleague, Solution Architect, and I saw the challenges
            related to
            <b>communication</b> with colleagues. It is essential to understand the
            <b>needs</b> of the company, follow the <b>processes</b>, and manage
            <b>resistances to change</b>. I understood that <b>digitalization</b
            > can be a way to reduce costs and improve efficiency, but it is also
            important to take into account the needs and preferences of employees.
        </p>
        <p class="my-2 text-justify">
            Thus, this internship allowed me to <b>develop</b> my skills in technology,
            communication (especially in English), and collaboration, and I returned
            with an enriching experience and reinforced skills.

            During my apprenticeship at Thuasne, I had the opportunity to work
            on a wide range of projects, many of which were related to <b>IoT</b
            >
            (Internet of Things) and heavily reliant on <b>cloud technologies</b
            >. For application deployment on Azure, I learnt and used Kubernetes
            and Docker, ensuring <b>efficient and scalable solutions</b>. I also
            undertook
            <b>pure development tasks</b>, taking an existing application and
            migrating it to the latest versions of Vue and Loopback. My work
            spanned across various programming languages, including Python,
            Java, PHP, and JavaScript, showcasing my <b

            I also worked on a project to develop an application using <b

            (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), which involved creating
            a <b>REST API</b> to manage patient data. The whole project idea was
            to create an end-to-end platform where IoT devices datas are ingested
            and integreted to the patient workflow. Making the data visible on the
            cloud by doctors and patients themselves. This project was particularly
            challenging, as it required me to learn a lot including <b>FHIR</b>, <b
                >health data reglementations</b

            I completed an internship at Ciril Group where I <b>developed</b> an
            application using Scrapy in Python. This application was designed to
            automatically retrieve addresses of retail outlets from the internet.
            It had a predefined list of retail chains and would navigate to each
            chain's website to extract all store addresses. Subsequently, the addresses
            were <b>processed</b>, <b>cleaned</b>, and <b>stored</b> for future use
            and mapping. This experience enhanced my proficiency in bweb scraping
            and data processing, as well as my ability to create practical solutions
            for <b>real-world business needs</b>.
